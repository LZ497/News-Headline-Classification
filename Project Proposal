items (this needs to be discussed with the instructor during office hours prior to
submission):
a. High level description of what you plan to do, and why you think it is interesting.

b. A detailed description of the methods you will use to achieve this:
What modeling approach do you intend to use?
What data do you intend to you use?
How will your system be evaluated and what are the evaluation criteria?
Are there any special computational/hardware considerations?
What are the biggest unknowns that might dictate the success or failure of this project?

c. How will the results of your work be presented? Will this be a live demo, a written report,
a slide deck + oral presentation? Any of these are acceptable! Demos can be given along
with reports/presentations.
