"Sunday Roundup. This week, all eyes were on Ferguson, Missouri, where unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by a white police officer. Further inflaming matters was the way largely peaceful protests of the shooting were met with tear gas and armored vehicles (and the arrest of journalists, including HuffPost's Ryan Reilly). This hyper-aggressive response raised bipartisan alarm about the militarization of America's police forces, which have received $4.3 billion in military hardware -- including 435 armored vehicles and 93,763 machine guns -- since 2006. This arms buildup partially grew out of the War on Drugs, which has largely become a war on young black and brown men; 50 percent of those impacted by SWAT raids are black and Latino. Though Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson helped restore calm to Ferguson by boldly replacing pointed assault rifles with hugs, handshakes and active listening, the simmering issues of race and how we police our communities cry out for a larger national conversation.",sunday roundup week eye ferguson missouri unarmed black teenager michael brown fatally shoot white police officer inflame matter way largely peaceful protest shooting meet tear gas armored vehicle arrest journalist include huffpost ryan reilly hyper aggressive response raise bipartisan alarm militarization america police force receive $ numbr numbr billion military hardware include numbr armored vehicle numbr machine gun numbr arm buildup partially grow war drug largely war young black brown man numbr percent impact swat raid black latino missouri highway patrol captain ron johnson help restore calm ferguson boldly replace pointed assault rifle hug handshake active listen simmer issue race police community cry large national conversation,WORLD NEWS,POLITICS,POLITICS

Through all her iterations, struggles, ups and downs, there was never anything fake about her -- except for her plastic-surgery-altered face, which, of course, she gleefully lampooned. Asked what she wanted on her tombstone, she replied: ""She had a great time.""
